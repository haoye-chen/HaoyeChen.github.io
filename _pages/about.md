My name is Haoye Chen. I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Division of Transport Planning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. I am supervised by Prof. Zhenliang Ma and co-supervised by Prof. Jan Kronqvist (Department of Mathematics, KTH), Prof. David Z.W. Wang (Nanyang Technological University), and Prof. Wilco Burghout (Division of Transport Planning, KTH).

My research field primarily focuses on multimodal mobility systems, with a specific emphasis on Mobility-on-Demand services. On the demand side, I study the choice-based optimization problem that optimizes service operations while incorporating demand modeling of the multinomial logit model. On the supply side, I study the optimization of detailed-level operations, including traveling, waiting, rebalancing, and charging of vehicles in a multimodal system.
