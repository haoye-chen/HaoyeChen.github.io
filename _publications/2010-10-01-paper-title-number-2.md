This paper optimizes the vehicle operation and charging for integrated electric mobility-on-demand services and public transit in the multimodal mobility system. The advancement in automatic driving and electric vehicles introduces challenges in operating MoD services jointly with PT services. However, existing literature on optimizing multimodal mobility systems lacks (1) the energy capacity and en-route charging behavior of MoD services, and (2) the temporal dynamics. We propose an generic network flow model to optimize an electric multimodal mobility system by representing the temporal interactions among customers, electric MoD vehicles, and PT services. The model captures (1) the traveling, waiting, and inter-/intra-mode transfers of customers, (2) the routing, rebalancing, waiting, and charging of MoD vehicles, and (3) the schedules and routes of PT services. We perform a case study based on a real dataset from Färingsö island, Stockholm. We compare the existing PT services and the electric multimodal mobility system integrating MoD with PT. The results suggest the integration can overall reduce 11.35% average travel time and 1.90% average travel distance for customers. It also significantly decreases the average initial waiting time (44.59%), maximum travel time (50.00%), and average transfer time (38.20%) for customers. Moreover, the intermodal transfers mainly occur in one location on the island, indicating a minor modification of existing infrastructure for the challenging service coordination problem in the multimodal mobility systems.
